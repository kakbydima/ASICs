To verify designed SRAM transistor-level block, the verilog behavioral SRAM unit was built (based on design description) for the sake of simulation time.
Given the behavioral SRAM module, the counterpart was built (SRAM_tester.v) to evaluate whether all write/read adresses have no flaw.
The SRAM tester was eventually used to confirm the read/write for SRAM transistor-level block.
